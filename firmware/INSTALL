This directory contains the firmware for the guider port device.

Configuration:

The firmware is configured using the GNU autotools. This means that
the build system has first to be set up using the commands

	libtoolize -f
	aclocal
	autoheader
	automake -a -c
	autoconf

The firmware requires the LUFA library that can be downloaded from
www.fourwalledcubicle.com. After unpacking the library, use the
--with-lufa option to configure the firmware with the location of
the LUFA library. If you unpack the library to /var/tmp/lufa, then
you should give the configure option

	./configure --host=avr --with-lufa=/var/tmp/lufa

The --host option is necessary to tell configure to cross compile
for the AVR platform.

The serial number, the vendor id and the product id are hard wired 
into the code. The default values are:

	vendor id:  	0xF055
	product id: 	0x1234
	serial number:	12345678

If you want to change them, you should modify the code in descriptor.c,
search for the string "CONFIGURATION" to locate the definitions of these
variables. Note that if you change vendor id or product id, you also have
to change the guider port client program gpclient.c or you will have to
use the -v and -p options to gpclient in each call.

Installation:

The USB descriptor containing the serial number is located in the EEPROM
of the microcontroller.  This means that the software cannot work by
simply flashing the firmware, one needs to separately load the serial
number string into the EEPROM. The advantage is that the serial number
can be set independently of the software installation.

There are two targets in the Makefile to install the software and
the serial number:

	make flash	# install the firmware in flash memory
	make eeprom	# install the serial number descriptor

Note that writing flash resets the EEPROM, so the commands have to
be issued in the order specified.
